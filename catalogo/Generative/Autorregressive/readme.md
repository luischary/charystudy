The paper introduces LlamaGen, a family of autoregressive image generation models that leverage the next-token prediction paradigm from large language models (LLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image generation. Key contributions include the development of an efficient image tokenizer with high reconstruction quality, scalable class-conditional image generation models ranging from 111M to 3.1B parameters, and a text-conditional model that demonstrates competitive visual quality and text alignment. The authors also optimize inference speed using LLM serving frameworks, achieving significant speedups. The work emphasizes the potential of vanilla autoregressive models in visual generation, challenging the dominance of diffusion models and contributing to the open-source community with released models and codes.
