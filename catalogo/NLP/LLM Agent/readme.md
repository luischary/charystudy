The paper introduces PEARL, a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) when dealing with long documents. PEARL operates in three stages: action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. It decomposes complex questions into a sequence of executable actions, allowing LLMs to generate more accurate and comprehensive answers compared to traditional prompting methods like zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting. The framework was evaluated on a challenging subset of the QuALITY dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy, particularly for questions requiring extensive reasoning over long contexts. The authors highlight the importance of each stage in PEARL and suggest that it represents a significant step towards leveraging LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.

This paper introduces AIOS, an operating system designed to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of large language model (LLM)-based intelligent agents. AIOS addresses challenges such as resource allocation, context maintenance, and the integration of heterogeneous agents. It features a specialized LLM kernel that includes modules for agent scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, tool management, and access control. The architecture aims to optimize the performance of LLM agents by enabling concurrent execution and efficient resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of AIOS, paving the way for future developments in the AIOS ecosystem.
