### New State-of-the-Art for Question Answering on Portuguese SQuAD v1.1

This study presents advancements in Extractive Question Answering (QA) for the Portuguese language using the SQuAD-BR dataset, a Portuguese translation of SQuAD v1.1. The authors fine-tuned BERTimbau Base and BERTimbau Large models, achieving state-of-the-art results on the dataset. They improved upon previous models by optimizing the fine-tuning process and leveraging transfer learning, resulting in enhanced performance metrics (Exact Match and F1 Score). The research highlights the potential of large pre-trained language models in addressing the scarcity of high-quality datasets for Portuguese NLP tasks.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09144v2

This paper presents the PTT5 model, a T5 variant pretrained on the BrWac corpus, a large dataset of Brazilian Portuguese web pages. The authors demonstrate that PTT5 outperforms original T5 models and multilingual models on Portuguese NLP tasks, specifically in sentence entailment prediction and named entity recognition. The study emphasizes the importance of using a Portuguese vocabulary for improved performance. The results indicate that monolingual pretraining significantly enhances model effectiveness for Portuguese tasks, and the authors provide their code and models for public use.

### BERTimbau: Pretrained BERT Models for Brazilian Portuguese

**2020-10-01**

This work presents BERTimbau, a set of pretrained BERT models specifically designed for Brazilian Portuguese, trained on the brWaC corpus. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on three NLP tasks: Sentence Textual Similarity (STS), Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The study also includes a tokenization analysis, revealing a strong correlation between task performance and subword splits, and discusses the implications for future research. The models are made publicly available to support further NLP research in Portuguese.
