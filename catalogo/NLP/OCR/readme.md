The authors propose Universal Document Processing (UDOP), a foundation model for Document AI that integrates text, image, and layout modalities for various document tasks, including understanding and generation. UDOP utilizes a Vision-Text-Layout Transformer to create a unified representation of these modalities, enhancing their interaction. It employs innovative self-supervised learning objectives and is pretrained on large-scale unlabeled document corpora alongside diverse labeled datasets. UDOP achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight Document AI tasks and is the first model to enable high-quality document editing and content customization, setting a new benchmark in the field.

This paper introduces the General OCR Theory and a new model called GOT, aimed at advancing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from the traditional OCR-1.0 systems to a more versatile OCR-2.0 framework. The GOT model, with 580 million parameters, is designed as a unified, end-to-end architecture capable of recognizing a wide range of artificial optical characters, including text, formulas, charts, and more, across various input styles. Key features include support for both scene and document images, interactive OCR capabilities, and the ability to generate formatted outputs. The authors demonstrate the model's superior performance through extensive experiments, highlighting its efficiency and practicality compared to existing OCR systems and large vision-language models (LVLMs).
