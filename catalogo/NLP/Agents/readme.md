### AutoWebGLM: Bootstrap And Reinforce A Large Language Model-based Web Navigating Agent

**2024-04-04**

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03648v1

The paper introduces AUTOWEBGLM, an advanced web navigation agent based on the ChatGLM3-6B model, designed to overcome limitations of existing large language models (LLMs) in real-world web tasks. Key contributions include an HTML simplification algorithm for better webpage comprehension, a hybrid human-AI method for building a robust training dataset, and a novel bilingual benchmark, AutoWebBench, for evaluating web browsing capabilities. The authors demonstrate that AUTOWEBGLM outperforms previous models like GPT-4 on various benchmarks, although it still faces challenges in achieving human-level performance in complex web navigation tasks.

This paper introduces CodeAct, a framework that enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to generate executable Python code as actions, enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks. The authors demonstrate that CodeAct outperforms traditional methods using JSON or text formats, achieving up to a 20% higher success rate in multi-turn interactions. They also present CodeActInstruct, a dataset of 7,000 multi-turn interactions designed for instruction tuning, which improves LLM performance in agent-oriented tasks without compromising general capabilities. The resulting model, CodeActAgent, fine-tuned from LLaMA-2 and Mistral, showcases improved task-solving abilities and self-debugging features, making it a significant advancement in the development of autonomous LLM agents.
