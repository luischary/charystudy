### EXPERTQA: Expert-Curated Questions and Attributed Answers

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07852

The paper presents EXPERTQA, a high-quality long-form question-answering dataset created through expert curation across 32 diverse fields. It addresses the critical need for language models to provide factually correct information with reliable attributions, particularly in high-stakes domains like medicine and law. The authors conducted an evaluation study involving 484 experts who formulated questions and assessed responses generated by various systems. Key findings indicate that while retrieval-augmented systems often produce complete attributions, they struggle with citation for all cite-worthy claims. The study highlights the importance of expert involvement in evaluating language model outputs and suggests that existing automatic methods for attribution and factuality estimation require improvement. The dataset aims to enhance future models and evaluation methods in long-form question answering.
