This paper introduces CLASI, a high-quality simultaneous speech translation system inspired by human interpreters. CLASI employs a novel data-driven read-write strategy to optimize translation quality and latency, addressing challenges such as in-domain terminology translation through a multi-modal retrieval module. The system, supported by large language models (LLMs), achieves significant improvements in valid information proportion (VIP) metrics, outperforming existing systems and demonstrating human parity in translation quality. The authors propose a new evaluation metric, VIP, to better reflect the effectiveness of simultaneous interpretation, and they provide a comprehensive framework for CLASI's architecture and training methodology.
