EVA-GAN introduces a novel approach to high-fidelity audio generation using scalable generative adversarial networks, addressing limitations in existing models such as spectral discontinuities and blurriness in high-frequency domains. The authors present a model with approximately 200 million parameters, trained on a comprehensive dataset of 36,000 hours of 44.1kHz audio. Key contributions include a context-aware module that enhances performance without significant computational overhead, an innovative training pipeline that improves stability and efficiency, and a Human-In-The-Loop artifact measurement toolkit for better alignment with human perception. The results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in both objective and subjective evaluations, establishing EVA-GAN as a new benchmark in audio synthesis.
