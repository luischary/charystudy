This paper introduces WavTokenizer, a novel acoustic codec model designed for efficient audio language modeling. WavTokenizer achieves extreme compression by utilizing a single quantizer, requiring only 40 or 75 tokens for one second of audio at a 24kHz sampling rate. It demonstrates superior reconstruction quality, evidenced by high UTMOS scores, and effectively captures rich semantic information through an expanded VQ space and improved attention networks. The model's architecture includes a convolutional encoder, a single quantizer, and an advanced decoder that employs an inverse Fourier transform for audio reconstruction. Extensive experiments validate WavTokenizer's performance across various audio domains, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining a unified modeling approach for speech, music, and audio.
