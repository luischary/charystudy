### FCM: THE FUZZY c-MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM

**1984-01-01**

This paper presents a FORTRAN-IV implementation of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm, which is applicable to various geostatistical data analysis problems. The FCM algorithm generates fuzzy partitions and prototypes for numerical data, allowing for the identification of substructures in datasets. Key features include the use of different norms (Euclidean, Diagonal, Mahalanobis), an adjustable weighting factor for noise sensitivity, and the ability to accept variable numbers of clusters. The paper discusses the mathematical foundations of fuzzy clustering, the optimization criteria for determining fuzzy c-partitions, and the algorithm's convergence properties. Additionally, it highlights the importance of cluster validity measures in assessing the quality of the clustering results.
