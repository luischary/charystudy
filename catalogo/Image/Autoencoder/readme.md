This paper presents a decomposition of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to identify a term that measures total correlation between latent variables, which motivates the β-TCVAE (Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder) as an improved method for learning disentangled representations without additional hyperparameters. The authors introduce a new metric called the mutual information gap (MIG) to evaluate disentanglement quantitatively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that β-TCVAE achieves better interpretability and robustness compared to existing methods, establishing a strong correlation between total correlation and disentanglement.
