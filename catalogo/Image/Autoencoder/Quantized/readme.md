The authors propose HR-VQVAE, a multi-layer variational autoencoder that learns hierarchical discrete representations for image reconstruction and generation. By introducing a novel objective function, HR-VQVAE enables each layer to learn from the residuals of previous layers, effectively linking representations hierarchically. Experimental results demonstrate that HR-VQVAE outperforms baseline models like VQVAE and VQVAE-2 in terms of image quality and diversity, while also mitigating the codebook collapse issue. The hierarchical structure enhances decoding speed and allows for larger codebook sizes, making HR-VQVAE suitable for high-load tasks.
