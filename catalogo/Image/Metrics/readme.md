This paper investigates the effectiveness of deep learning features as metrics for assessing perceptual similarity between images, contrasting them with traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM. The authors introduce a large-scale dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments and demonstrate that deep features from various architectures (including VGG, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet) significantly outperform traditional metrics in aligning with human perception. They find that perceptual similarity is an emergent property of deep visual representations, and that even unsupervised and self-supervised networks can achieve high performance. The study emphasizes the importance of training signals and proposes a method for calibrating existing networks to improve their perceptual similarity assessments.
