This paper presents a residual learning framework to facilitate the training of very deep neural networks, addressing the degradation problem where deeper networks exhibit higher training errors. The authors propose a reformulation of layers to learn residual functions rather than unreferenced functions, allowing for easier optimization. They demonstrate the effectiveness of residual networks (ResNets) through extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with networks up to 152 layers deep, which outperform previous architectures like VGG nets while maintaining lower complexity. The paper also reports significant improvements in object detection tasks on COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, showcasing the general applicability of the residual learning principle across various visual recognition tasks.
