This paper presents XGBoost, a highly scalable tree boosting system that achieves state-of-the-art results in various machine learning tasks. The authors introduce several key innovations, including a sparsity-aware algorithm for handling sparse data, a weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning, and optimizations for cache access patterns, data compression, and sharding. XGBoost is designed to run efficiently on large datasets, scaling to billions of examples while using fewer resources compared to existing systems. The paper highlights the system's performance in competitions, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications such as fraud detection, ad click prediction, and ranking problems.
